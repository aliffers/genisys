Genisys Master I/O library
--------------------------
This library will use a Genisys home automation master as a bridge to send and
receive Dynalite OpCodes onto the DyNet RS485 bus.

The library requires an Aurdino with a standard Ethernet shield, integrated
or otherwise as long as it can be accessed using the default Arduino Ethernet
library.

I do not expect this library to be of much use directly to anyone unless you
also happen to have a Genisys master, which is a local product developed here
in Perth by Light Application in Balcatta.  However, it effectively only has
two functions of send and receive, which could be rewritten to use some other
bridge device.

What this library does do that may be of interest, is it'll calculate the
checksum for the 8th byte of the OpCode before sending it, and it'll validate
the received OpCode's checksum, before calling the receive function.

Initialisation
--------------
All items of in the initialisation are Genisys specific, and have nothing to do
with the DyNet network.  The Genisys master expects a hostname as well as IP
address information, so this is supplied here.  The IPs are also used for the
UDP send/recv.

Functions
---------
sendOpCode: Expects an 8 byte array that is the OpCode.  This is then built
into the expected UDP message for the Genisys after calculating the OpCode
checksum and then sent.

receiveOpCodes
--------------
A while loop that simply receives all awaiting UDP datagrams that have arrived
since the last time the function was called.  It'll pull out the 8 hex codes
that make up the OpCode and send it to the function, to which a pointer is
provided as the parameter.
